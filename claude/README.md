## design-with-tailwind-plus

This skill will run whenever a web UI needs to be built. 

The `tailwind_all_components.json` file is intentionally not in git because
those components may only be accessed by someone with a [Tailwind Plus
account](https://tailwindcss.com/plus) account. You may browse the component
site freely, but to download their source you need an account.
